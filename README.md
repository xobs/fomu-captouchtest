# Fomu Captouch Test

This repository represents an attempt to create a working captouch implementation for Fomu.
It is meant to allow experimentation with various approaches.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the Fomu Toolchain installed
2. Run `python captouchtest.py`
3. Write the resulting build/gateware/test.bin to a Fomu
4. Interact with the Captouch addresses via the wishbone bridge.
